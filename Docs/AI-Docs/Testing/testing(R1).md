# Initial Testing #

## Summary and observations:
- Use " instead of ' anywhere we are passing a string, as the string may contain apostrophes (') which then causes problems.
- Some hallucinations observed: received more questions than asked in 10/27 iterations (3 prompts x 9 PDFs)iterations. Asked for 5, got up to 22, but never less than 5 questions.
- A reasonable time limit needs to be set for RabbitMQ Integration Test as larger documents take well over 10 seconds to execute (large == 50+ pages)
- Quality of generated questions gets better as more details are provided. Based on our tests, by far the best prompt is: **This is a submission by a university student. Generate five viva questions based on this document that assess: the student's understanding of the material, their ability to discuss the concepts, and their capacity to expand on the ideas.**
