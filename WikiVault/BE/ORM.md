# Object-Relational Mapping

## GPT Description
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a crucial concept in Database Management Systems (DBMS). It acts as a bridge between object-oriented programming and relational databases.
1. **Entities**: In ORM, entities correspond to objects or classes in object-oriented programming. These entities are bound to tables in relational databases, serving as abstractions of business concepts within an application.

2. **Relationships**: ORM maps how entities relate to each other, defining relationships between database tables. These relationships ensure data integrity and mirror the applicationâ€™s components.

3. **Persistence**: ORM allows data to persist even when the application is closed or restarted. It stores data securely in a relational database, making it available even when the application is not running.

4. **Translation**: ORM acts as a translator between the database and the application, enabling developers to work with objects in their programming language that map to corresponding database entities (tables, views, or stored procedures).
