# Week 0
Unit guide not released for this session
Not sure how to best prepared for these classes
Discussions with 4060 students but little insight gained

# Week 1
Explanation about the project conveyed by Ansgar

I have nominated AI as first preference, Frontend as second and Backend as third. This was by recommendation by Deb.
I think this project could be done in a weekend with some requisite knowledge


# Week 2
From here I will use the format for all logs: **What** **When** **Who** 

**What**
Met the Nevada team today, very general project discussions occurred.
Project management structure designated
Please discuss also project management issues, such as who will be
the product owner, and who will fill other roles. Agree on how you
want to stay in contact when you want to work where, and on what
platform you want to collaborate. You should create a Team GitHub
repository, by following the link on iLearn. You can, however, decide
to use other tools, as long as it is documented in the GitHub repo.
