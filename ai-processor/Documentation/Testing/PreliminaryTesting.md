## Test PT01 ##
### Input: ### 
*Prompt:* Generate 10 viva questions based on this file, that test the author's familiarity with the written text, their ability to discuss proficiently, and their ability to expand critically on the topic.
*Attachement:* A document titled "309255_Zarin_Tasnim_Isra_46254927_cp1050FinalReport_6488030_1106933699" which contains information about a system proposed by the student, including functional and non-functional requirements, test metrics, and reflection. 
### Output: ###
Here are ten viva questions based on the provided document, designed to test the author's familiarity with the content, their ability to discuss the material proficiently, and their capacity for critical expansion:

**Familiarity with the Text**
1. Can you explain how the HIVE TRANSIT system integrates with existing transport management systems, particularly focusing on Opal card tappers?
2. What are the main components involved in monitoring the number of people using public transport, according to your report?
3. Could you detail the three most important non-functional requirements you prioritized for your IoT product and explain why you ranked them in that order?
4. How does your system utilize CCTV footage and footstep sensors to estimate the number of people at bus stops or train stations?
5. What measures does your system take to ensure the security and privacy of user data, particularly in relation to account registration and requests for service?

**Discussion Proficiency**
6. In your report, you emphasized the importance of speed as a non-functional requirement. How do you believe this priority impacts the overall user experience and system performance?
7. The report mentions using machine learning models for human detection. Can you discuss the challenges you might face in training these models and how you plan to address them?
8. You suggested adding a "Choose a city" option to expand the app's functionality. How would this feature impact the system's architecture and data management?

**Critical Expansion**
9. Given the potential privacy concerns around CCTV and footstep sensors, how could you improve or modify these features to enhance user trust without compromising the system's functionality?
10. Considering the rapid advancements in AI and IoT, how could HIVE TRANSIT evolve in the next five years to stay ahead of technological changes and user expectations?

These questions should effectively evaluate the author's understanding, ability to engage in meaningful discussion, and capacity for critical thought regarding their project.

**Observations:** Given the criteria, the questions seem to be of good quality. However, the prompt needs to be improved in a way that the output only returns 10 questions without any unrelated text or segmentation.
