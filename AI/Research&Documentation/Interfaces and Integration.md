### 2. API Access

#### 2.1 Authentication and Authorization
Explain the methods of authentication and authorization supported by the API.
- **API Key**: Explain how to obtain and use an API key.
- **OAuth 2.0**: Describe the OAuth 2.0 flow supported (e.g., Client Credentials, Authorization Code).

To access the API, an API key is required. An API key can be obtained by registering on the VivaMQ system. The system administrator would then authorize the API key with the 'Authorization' header for each request as follows:

Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

The API supports the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework. The flow involves the following steps:

1) The user is directed to the VivaMQ authorization server's login page. The user will then be prompted by the service to authorize or deny the application access to their account.

2) Once the authorization had been granted, the server redirects the user back to the application with an authorization code. 

3) The application requests for an access token by passing the authorization code. The request would be a POST request also conatining the client credentials such as client ID and client secret.

4) If the authorization code is valid, the server will respond with an access token.

5) The applcation can now use the token to access the userâ€™s account. The access token will be included in the 'Authorization' header when making API requests (Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN). 


#### 2.2 Endpoints

List and describe the primary API endpoints, including base URLs for different environments (e.g., production, staging).
- **Base URL**: `https://api.example.com/`

Key Endpoint:
- Viva Question Generation:
  - /questions
  - Description: Generates Viva questions based on a student's submission.
- Users:
  - /users
  - Description: Create, update, delete or retrieve user information.
- Submissions:
  - /submissions
  - Description: Manage items such as assignments and project submitted by students.



#### 2.3 Rate Limiting
Describe any rate limiting applied to the API, including limits and how to handle them.

The API rate limits are as follows:
- 500 RPM: Maximum of 500 requests per minue.
- 30,000 TPD: Daily limit of 30,000 tokens.

If the API rate limit is hit, the API will return a '429 Too Many Requests' error. 
Developers are advised to implement retry logic with exponential backoff. Retrying with exponential backoff means to perform a short sleep when a rate limit error is encountered, then retrying the unsuccessful request. The process is repeated with an extended sleep duration if the request is still denied. This keeps going until either the request is fullfilled or the allotted amount of tries is reached.

### 3. How to Use the API

#### 3.1 Making Requests
Explain how to make a request to the API, including required headers (e.g., Content-Type, Authorization).

To make use of the API, setup an envrionment and authenticate the API. The follwoing example illustrates generating Viva questions using the OpenAI API. 

**Import necessary modules and load the environment variable from a '.env' file:**
```javascript
import OpenAI from 'openai';
import fs from 'fs';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();  

console.log("API Key:", process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY); // need your own API and env file setup
```
- `dotenv.config();` : Loads the enviroment varaibles defined in the `.env` file into `process.env`
- `console.log("API Key:", process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY);` : Prints the API key to the console. Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the client's own API key and ensure that the key is correctly set up in the envrionment file.

**Initialize the OpenAI client using the API Key:**
```javascript
const client = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
```
- Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your own API key
- This creates an instance of the OpenAI client using the API key. 

**Upload a file to the AI:**
```javascript
const file = await client.files.create({
    file: fs.createReadStream("testpdf.pdf"),
    purpose: "assistants",
});

console.log('File uploaded successfully:', file);
```
- `client.files.create`: Creates or uploads a file to the API.
- `file: fs.createReadStream("testpdf.pdf")`: Creates a readable stream from the file `testpdf.pdf` and sets it to `file`. The file is then sent to the API.
- `purpose: "assistants"` : Indicates that the file is to be used by the AI assistant.
- `console.log('File uploaded successfully:', file)`: prints a success message together with the file information onto the console.


```javascript
const vectorStore = await client.beta.vectorStores.create({
    name: "Assessment1",
    file_ids: [file.id],
});

console.log('Vector store created successfully:', vectorStore);
```
- Creates a vector store called `Assessment1` using the uploaded file ID. This allows the AI to search through and retrive data from the document.

**Creating an AI assistant:**
```javascript
const assistant = await client.beta.assistants.create({
    name: "Academic Viva Creator",
    instructions: "You are an expert computer science expert who has been asked to assist with generating specific viva questions for assessments uploaded.",
    model: "gpt-4o",
    tools: [{ type: "file_search" }],
});

console.log('Assistant created successfully:', assistant);
```
- `client.beta.assistants.create` : Creates an AI assistant using the client's API key.
- `name` : Sets the name of the assistant to 'Academic Viva Creator'.
- `instructions` : Defines the role and purpose of the assistant.
- `model: "gpt-4o"` : Specifies the AI model being used.
- `tools: [{ type: "file_search" }]` : Indicates that the AI assistant is equipped with the `file_search` tool to search through the file. 

**The AI assistant is updated with the vectore store:**
```javascript
await client.beta.assistants.update(assistant.id, {
    tool_resources: { file_search: { vector_store_ids: [vectorStore.id] } },
});
    
console.log('Assistant updated');
```
- `client.beta.assistants.update`: Updates the existing AI assistant.
- It takes two arguments `assistant.id` and the object (tool_resources, file_search, vector_store_ids) containing the update information.
- `assistant.id`: Unique ID of the created assistant.
- `tool_resources`: Indicates the resources for the assistant's tool.
- `file_search`: Indicates the file search tool that was created.
- `vector_store_ids`: An array containing vectoreStore.id. This links the created vectore store to the assistant's file search function.


**Create a thread to run the assistant:**
```javascript
const thread = await client.beta.threads.create();

let run = await client.beta.threads.runs.createAndPoll(
    thread.id,
    { 
        assistant_id: assistant.id,
        instructions: "Read the PDF and generate viva questions specific to the PDF",
    }
);
```
- `const thread = await client.beta.threads.create()`: Creates a new thread using the API.
- `let run = await client.beta.threads.runs.createAndPoll`:
   - Starts a new `run` instance within the created thread.
   - `createAndPoll`: The method creats the run and also polls for its completion.
   - Runs the assistant in the thread and instructs it to read the provided PDF and generate Viva questions.

#### 3.2 Handling Responses
Describe the standard structure of API responses, including status codes and format (e.g., JSON, XML).

After the API runs the program, it checks the status and generates Viva questions. The standard structure of an API response is presented below:
```javascript
if (run.status === 'completed') {
    const messages = await client.beta.threads.messages.list(
        run.thread_id
    );
    for (const message of messages.data.reverse()) {
        console.log(`${message.role} > ${message.content[0].text.value}`);
    }
} else {
    console.log(run.status);
}
```
- If the run has completed succesfully:
   - `const messages = await client.beta.threads.messages.list(run.thread_id)`: Retrieves messages in the thread associated with the run.
   - `for (const message of messages.data.reverse())`: Loops the message in reverse order. This is done to display the messages in chronological order.
   - `console.log(${message.role} > ${message.content[0].text.value})`: 
      - Prints the role of the sender and the content for each message.
      - `message.content[0].text.value`: Indicates that the text value of the first element is being accessed.
      - Outputs the generated Viva questions.
- If the run was unsuccesful:
   - `console.log(run.status)`: Prints the current status of the run to the console.

#### 3.3 Error Handling
Detail the error codes and messages, their meanings, and recommendations for handling them.

A simlple error handling structure can be represented below: 
```javascript
catch (error) {
  console.error('Error during setup:', error);
}
```
- Catches any error and logs them for troubleshooting.

Other Error codes, messages and recommendations for handling them:
| Error Code | Message | Meaning | Recommendations for handling them |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| 401 | Invalid Authentication | Authentication was invalid | Ensure the correct API key and requesting organization are being used |
